<div class="bg">Wikipedia is an Internet encyclopedia project in many languages.It is free of charge: users do not pay. Also, it is "open content". This means anyone can copy it, and make changes to it if they follow the rules for copying or editing. Wikipedia is owned
	by an American organization, Wikimedia Foundation, which is in San Francisco, California. Its name is a combination of the two words wiki, a Hawaiian word for quick, and encyclopedia. Because the word was made by combining parts of those words, it is
	a portmanteau. It was started on January 10, 2001 by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger as part of an earlier Internet encyclopedia named Nupedia. On January 15, 2001, Wikipedia became a separate website of its own. It is a wiki that runs using the software
	MediaWiki (like all other Wikimedia projects). Anyone who wishes to, can change the pages in Wikipedia, or even make new ones. Wikipedia has a standard page layout for all pages in the encyclopedia. As of December 2007, Wikipedia had about 9.25 million
	pages in 253 languages, and more than 1.74 billion words across all Wikipedias. The English Wikipedia is the biggest. When the Simple English Wikipedia began in 2003, the ordinary English Wikipedia already had 150,000 articles, and seven other Wikipedias
	in other languages had over 15,000 articles. Since the other Wikipedias already have so many articles, most Simple English articles take articles from other Wikipedias and make them simple; they are usually not new articles. Right now, the Simple English
	Wikipedia has 119,283 articles. As of May 2016, it was the 51st largest Wikipedia. This makes Simple English articles a good way to understand difficult articles from the ordinary English Wikipedia. If someone cannot understand an idea in complex English,
	they can read the Simple English article. Many articles are shorter than the same articles in the English Wikipedia.[3] Technical subjects use some terms which are not simple. Editors try to explain these terms in a simple way.</div>
